# ``SwiftPMDocs``

Package your Swift software.

The Swift Package Manager (SwiftPM) is a tool for managing distribution of source code, aimed at making it easy to share your code and reuse others’ code. The tool directly addresses the challenges of compiling and linking Swift packages, managing dependencies, versioning, and supporting flexible distribution and collaboration models.

We’ve designed the system to make it easy to share packages on services like GitHub, but packages are also great for private personal development, sharing code within a team, or at any other granularity.

Swift Package Manager includes a build system that can build, test, and run software for macOS and Linux. Starting with Xcode 11, Xcode integrates with SwiftPM to provide support for including packages in iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS applications.
